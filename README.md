<h3 align="left">About Me:</h3>
<h4 align="left">I have a strong foundation in data-driven decision-making and advanced analytics. I have 3 years of hands-on experience working as a Data Analyst globally (in Europe and Africa) in the economic development and policy space. Most recently, I spent the summer as a Data Analyst at TechInsights in the Bay Area, where I developed a demand analysis model for AI chip processors and published key reports that provided actionable insights to the semiconductor industry. I am currently pursuing an M.S. in Business Analytics at USC Marshall School of Business, and I am eager to embark on a career leveraging my adept data analytical skills to deliver immediate value.</h4>
